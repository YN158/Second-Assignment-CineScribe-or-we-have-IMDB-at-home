# CineScribe (W.H.M.A.H)

Just a simple java application which gives you simple information about a movie and actors.
(note that simple does not mean "Did not want to rip my eyes out and shove them in James Gosling's throat)
(also I'm not one to write super serious reports on anything without jokes because there is no fun in that so apologies if you take some assignment way too seriously)
